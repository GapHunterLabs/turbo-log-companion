/**
 * Asks the user to rate the plugin on Marketplace, once, after they've
 * used a real number of successful log-statement insertions -- never
 * on install, never on a timer. Every call to [recordHit] here already
 * corresponds to one real insertion (never the validation-failed
 * branch). "Remove All Log Statements" never counts -- it's cleanup,
 * not the plugin's value proposition. Counts invocations directly
 * instead of tracking a set of seen keys.
 *
 * Threshold is deliberately lower than the detector-based plugins'
 * (5, not 10) -- an explicit action invocation is a much stronger
 * signal of real value than a passive finding the plugin noticed on
 * its own.
 *
 * Same "earn the ask" principle as other well-regarded plugins; never
 * re-asks once the user has either rated or dismissed it.
 *
 * Persisted via [PropertiesComponent] at the application level (not
 * per-project) -- how many times this plugin has been used isn't tied
 * to any one project, and neither is whether the user already
 * answered.
